# LatticeQCD_Jackknife
Calculates several physical quantities using jackknife averaging from Lattice QCD simulation data which has been processd by QuaHoG.

Libraries:

1. jk.cpp/.h: library of functions used for calculating jackknife averages and errors. Also includes several helper functions.
2. physQuants.cpp/.h: library of functions which calculate various physical quantities.
3. fitting.cpp/.h: library of functions used for fitting data.

Programs (see files for inputs):

1. effMass.cpp: program to calculate effective mass from two-point functions.
2. axialCharge.cpp: program to calculate the axial charge from two- and three-point functions.
3. scalarFF.cpp: program to calculate the scalar form factro from two- and three-point functions.
4. fitValue.cpp: program to fit data for a single values.
5. fitFormFactor.cpp: program to fit data for a number of momentum transfers to obtain the form factor.
